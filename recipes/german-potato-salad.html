	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 medium potatoes, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
			<li>4 slices bacon</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white wine vinegar</li>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until fork-tender, 8 to 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving drippings in the skillet. Chop or crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.</li>
